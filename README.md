### Course objective:

To provide an overview of the principles of Bayesian statistics and their practical application. 

### Short description:

Bayesian models are finding ever wider applications in science and in practical problem solving, where informed decisions and choices need to be made under uncertainty or limited information. The course provides an overview and fundamental practical skills for formulating Bayesian models, fitting them to data, and validating and interpreting results. The focus will be somewhat less on theoretical nuances and more on the development of practical skills - which, however, require a fundamental understanding of the theory. The course is based to a large extent on independent preparatory work (mainly based on Richard McElreath's book "Statistical Rethinking"), while in the seminars we will work in small groups on practical problems, mainly using the Python package PyMC. 

### Learning outcome:

On successful completion of the course, students will be able to:

- Understand and apply the principles of Bayesian statistics to the analysis of different types of data.
- Understand and formulate Bayesian models and work with prior distributions and simulations.
- diagnose, compare and validate different Bayesian models
- fit more complex hierarchical models and interpret their results correctly

### Prerequisites:

- Basic knowledge of statistics
- The practical part of the course requires the ability to work in Python. This can also be acquired during the course - we offer support and assistance for this - but an additional workload should be expected.
